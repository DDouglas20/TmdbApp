### Hackathon
Thank your for taking the time to review my submission!
Here the Read.me instruct you on how to setup the project:

Once the project is downloaded and you try to run it you'll notice it doesn't compile because the Secrets file is not included which houses the api key.
In order to run the program you'll need to:

1. Open a terminal and enter the project directory
2. Run this script: `chmod +x setup_secrets.sh
./setup_secrets.sh`
3. The Secrets file should be compiled and the project should be ready to run!

That should be all. I hope you enjoy!
